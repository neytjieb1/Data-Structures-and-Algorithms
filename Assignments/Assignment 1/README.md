#Assignment 1

The relationship between sparse tables and matrices is similar to the relationship between linked lists
and arrays. Sparse tables can be seen as linked lists in more dimensions. A sparse table need not be
only two dimensional, they can be extended to any dimension.  
  
Refer to Section 3.6 in the textbook. For this assignment you will have to implement and extend a
sparse table from two dimensions to three. Your task will be to create a mini-diary which you can use
to schedule to-do items.  
  
This assignment is divided into a number of steps. You must implement all of the steps. It is strongly
advised but not required that you implement this assignment in the order in which the steps are given.
